This sample demonstrates how a LiquidFun particle system can be used to generate unified groups of liquid-like particles that behave with different properties depending on the flag settings.

In this case, the group flag is set to "rigid" which keeps the simulated ice cubes relatively solid; notice, however, that the cubes begin "melting" into each other as they stack up.
